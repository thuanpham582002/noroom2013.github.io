In this article, we will learn about Restful API, and how to design it.
Let's get started.

## What is API?
An API stands for Application Program Interface.
It is basically a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other.

Some examples of API:
Think of an API like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish.
When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant's kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes.

## What is REST?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. (It is sometimes spelled "ReST".)
(State — the state of the application (web site) on a client’s computer changes as the client clicks from one link to the next. Ask the client clicks on the link, they request additional resources, and the application “state” changes.The state in rest is best explained here https://restfulapi.net/statelessness/)

REST is not a protocol or a standard, it is an architectural style. During the development phase, API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.

Like the other architectural styles, REST also has its guiding principles and constraints. These principles must be satisfied if a service interface has to be referred to as RESTful.

## What is RESTful API?
Restful API is an API that follows the REST architectural style. ^_^
