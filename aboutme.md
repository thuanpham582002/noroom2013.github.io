### My story


To be honest, I always feel that life is unfair to me. I'm not sure why, but I consistently feel that I'm not good enough. I don't feel adequate as a son, a brother, a friend, a lover, an employee, a boss, a citizen, or even as a human being. I perpetually feel that I fall short in every aspect. I constantly sense that I'm not good enough just being myself.

However, one day, I realized that I am not treating this life well.
